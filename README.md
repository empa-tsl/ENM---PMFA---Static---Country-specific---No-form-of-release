# ENM---PMFA---Static---Country-specific---No-form-of-release
ENM- and country-specific PMFA codes for year 2015

Each code runs for one European country and one ENM. The system studied and the results obtained are described in the publication: Kuenen et al. Inventory of country-specific emissions of engineered nanomaterials throughout the life cycle, submitted to the journal ES Nano in April 2020.

Transfer coefficients, uncertainty coefficients and production volumes are needed as input to the codes. 
Transfer coefficients and uncertainty coefficients files are matrices describing flows and uncertainties between all compartments (from column to row).
